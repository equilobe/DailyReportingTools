Prerequisites:
- SlikSvn client (for the svn log command)

Normal steps:
- XCopy application (Release version) to C:\Applications\SvnReporterV2 on the staging server.
- update policies with a different e-mail list (e.g. instead of a test email addresses to production email adresses)
- Open Task Scheduler
	- Click Add Task
		- Give a name to the task
		- Set "Run whether user is logged in or not"
		- Check "Run with highest privilages"
		- In the Triggers tab click New Trigger and select Daily
		- Select the date and time for the first start
		- In the Actions tab click New and browse for C:\Applications\SvnReporterV2\SvnLogReporter.exe		
		- Set the command line parameters to the apropriate polciy file for that instance (e.g. --policy Policies\equilobe.xml)
		- Set the "run in folder" to the appropriate folder (e.g. C:\Applications\SvnReporterV2). 
			Attention! All relative paths used in the policy file and when specifying 
			the policy file (from the command line attributes) will be relative to this path
			and not the path of the executable.
		- Click OK
		- You will be asked for your password. please supply it in order for the task to run when you are not logged in.

Current configuration:
Right now there are multiple policy files (which are part of the source code) in the Policies folder.
This folder is copied to the output folder and so are the policy files.
Both policy files use a relative path for the root of the logs and reports stored by the SvnReporter.
If you leave this path relative then you have to make sure the "run in folder" is
appropriately set when you schedule the task.

The application will not run without a policy file. To specify a policy file you can use:
SvnLogReporter --policy Policies\equilobe.xml
Be careful when using a relative path for the policy file.
